# Credit_Card_Approval_prediction

In this project, we are diving into the world of credit card approvals. The Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used. 

- Start by familiarizing yourself with the dataset, understanding the features, and getting a sense of the overall structure.

## Inspect the data:
- Dive deeper into the dataset, examining the characteristics of credit card applications. This step is crucial for gaining insights and understanding the data we are working with.

## Handle Missing Values:
- Missing data is a common challenge. Address this issue in multiple steps to ensure a comprehensive approach to handling missing values, making the dataset more robust.
  
## Preprocess the Data:
- Prepare the data for machine learning. This involves transforming and cleaning the dataset to ensure it's in a format that can be fed into a model.

## Split the Dataset into Train and Test Sets:
- Divide your dataset into two parts: one for training your model and the other for testing its performance. This helps assess how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data.

## Fit a Logistic Regression Model to the Train Set:
- Time to choose a model! Fit a logistic regression model to the training set. Logistic regression is a common choice for binary classification problems like credit card approval.

## Make Predictions and Evaluate Performance:
- Once your model is trained, use it to make predictions on the test set. Evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics to ensure it's making accurate predictions.

## Grid Search to make the Model Perform Better:
- Fine-tune your model by conducting a grid search. This involves systematically testing different hyperparameter combinations to find the optimal settings for your logistic regression model.

## Find the Best Performing Model:
After the grid search, identify the model with the best performance. This is the culmination of your efforts, resulting in an automatic credit card approval predictor ready for deployment.
